# JLibGraph: A comprehensive Java graph data structure and algorithms library

## What is JLibGraph?

:small_blue_diamond:JLibGraph is a Java library for handling graphs and perform operations on them. This is based on graph theory, branch responsible for studying the properties of graphs.

:small_blue_diamond:First, a graph constitutes a nonempty set of vertices and a set of edges. The edges are the lines that join the vertices of said graph, and can be classified into adjacent, parallel, cyclic or crossing; while the vertices are the elements that make up the graph and have a degree due to the number of edges it has. The path is the set of vertices interconnected by edges. 

:small_blue_diamond:On the other hand, this library will implement the different types of graphs:
- [X] Simple
- [ ] Multigraph 
- [X] Directed 
- [X] Labeled 
- [ ] Random 
- [ ] Hypergraph 
- [ ] Infinite 
- [ ] Flat 
- [ ] Regular 
- [ ] Dual
